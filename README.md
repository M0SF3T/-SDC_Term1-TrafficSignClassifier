Overview
---
Project #2 from the Udacity Self-Driving Car Program (SDC).
The program consists of a 5 layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify and recognize road traffic signs based on german standards.
The CNN is based on the LeNeT architecture and includes dropouts in between layers for increased performance.

Tools and Techniques
---

* Implemented in Tensor Flow (Python)
* Jupyter Notebooks

Results
---
92% accuracy using a test set from the original.
80% accuracy on random sample images not included in the original set (4 out 5 images correctly predicted).
